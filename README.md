**Partner Asking Web App**

Overview
This is a web application designed for a playful interaction where you can ask your partner out. The app features a humorous twist: when the partner tries to press "No," the button moves around, making it only possible to press "Yes." It's a fun way to express your affection and propose to your partner.

Features
Interactive Button: The "No" button moves around the screen to make it challenging to click, while the "Yes" button remains in place.
Simple and Fun: The web app is designed to be simple and fun, making the experience lighthearted and engaging.
